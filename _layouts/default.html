    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Guest requests WiFi.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Staff issues Square receipt,</strong> or guest enters purchase code into Captivi portal.</li>
      <li><strong>Captivi validates purchase</strong> in real time, and grants secure WiFi access for a set duration.</li>
      <li><strong>Guests browse, shop, or enjoy—worry free.</strong></li>
    </ol>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Does Captivi work with any WiFi system?</strong><br>
        Captivi is built specifically for Ubiquiti UniFi networks. We may expand to other platforms in the future—contact us if you have questions!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How does Square integration work?</strong><br>
        Captivi verifies guest WiFi access by checking for a valid Square receipt or code. You control the rules—such as how long access is granted, and whether refunds revoke access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Is guest data safe and private?</strong><br>
        Yes! Captivi only verifies purchase and device information. We don’t store or sell guest browsing data, and you’re always in control.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I customize the captive portal?</strong><br>
        Absolutely. Add your logo, colors, and messaging for a seamless guest experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What support is included?</strong><br>
        All maintenance plans include remote updates, monitoring (on Premium), and email support. Phone or onsite support is available by request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What if I need a network upgrade?</strong><br>
        Our team can help design, upgrade, or troubleshoot your UniFi environment—see our Network Design Services above.
